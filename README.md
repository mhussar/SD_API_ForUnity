# SD_API_ForUnity
Implementing the Stable Diffusion Text to Image REST API endpoint in C# in a Unity Project
This is a very basic implementation. It will allow you to generate images from Stable diffusion with a basic prompt but it does not contain a refined UI. I plan to 
continue development on this project and make a free release available of a fully operational UI to make use of all expected parameters for generating AI images with SD in future releases.
